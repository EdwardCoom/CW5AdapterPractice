# CW5: Adapter Practice!

Name: Zach Coomer

Date: 02/09/2023

## Description
A simple program that practices using Adapter design pattern. Includes UML diagram in Dia format.

## Challenges
This assignment was fairly straightforward, but using the IBear Grizzly as the constructor argument seems counterintuitive. 

## Design Decisions
This project code was fairly minimal so I decided to keep all classes in a file, all interfaces in a file, and main in it's own file.

## Files Required
* Classes.cs
	- All of the classes required in main() are listed and implemented here.
* Interfaces.cs
	- All of the interfaces required in main() are listed here.
* README.md
	- Here I list brief information about the program and topics related to the program.

## How to Run
This program is currently intended to be run in Visual Studios 2022.
